Title: "zkSQL: A Zero-Knowledge Proof Native SQL Query Engine for Privacy-Preserving Databases"

ðŸ›  Problem Statement
Traditional databases expose sensitive financial and personal data when executing queries, making them vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, and compliance risks. Current encryption methods secure data at rest and in transit but fail to protect data during computation (e.g., during SQL queries).

Goal:
Develop a custom SQL-like database engine that natively supports Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) based queries, enabling users to prove conditions on their data without exposing raw values.

ðŸ”¹ Features of zkSQL
ZKP-Native Queries:

Instead of SELECT SUM(amount) FROM transactions WHERE user_id = ?;, zkSQL returns a proof that the sum satisfies a condition (e.g., <$1000).
No raw data exposure to the querying party.
Custom Storage Engine:

Uses RocksDB-inspired key-value storage in Rust.
Encrypted commitment-based storage for privacy.
SQL Interface with ZKP Extension:

Developers can use standard SQL queries with a ZKP extension.
Example: SELECT zkProof(SUM(amount) < 1000) FROM transactions WHERE category = 'food';
Mobile-Friendly & Android Integration:

Lightweight embedded database for mobile apps.
Works as an alternative to SQLite with privacy features.
No Blockchain Dependency:

This is not a Web3/blockchain project.
Stand-alone privacy-focused database engine.
